# The Hackett Group - Juan Mar√≠a Morello's application

This project was developed with Angular 17 standalone components.

## Startup

- npm install
- npm start and open a tab on localhost:4200

## Assumptions and notes

- On the pie chart (Cars per household in USA 2021), I've assumed that the relevant piece of info
to retrieve the value to build the graph was Vehicles Available.
- On the multi axis chart (Population of Alabama, Florida and California), I've assumed that the
given graph on the dashboard-template.png was not built properly (too many deaths and births)
between years, and consider my graph a more proper graph
- There are some CSS issues that, due to time constraints, I was not able to fulfill properly,
and focused my work into building the data retrieval and manipulation in the most clean way
- I've used bootstrap 5 as a UI framework
